# Some important things to say here: Im retrieve alot of ideas from my favorite softwares, like: Chris Titus Wintool, Revo Uninstaller, TweakUI...
# I coded based on some scripts as well, like the AI remover from: https://github.com/zoicware/RemoveWindowsAI (i didnt include the CBS manipulation {component-based servicing}, this could break 
# the sistem removing some important stuff, ofc u can costumize it in their script but here im not going to do that because Malenia has already alot of working features (maybe one day))
